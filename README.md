# Anvil
Current status of the Rust interpreter for Arn
- [x] Place implied `_` into program -> first pass
- [x] Convert input stream into postfix notation for very easy parsing -> second pass
- [ ] Convert the postfix program stream into an AST -> third pass
- [ ] Environment for storing variables
- [ ] Parser that takes in AST -> type variability will be tricky
 
 MILESTONE: move to `Arn` repository in new branch
- [ ] Implement Sequences / Arrays
- [ ] Figure out how to implement `;`, `\`, and `@`
- [ ] Bug fixes
